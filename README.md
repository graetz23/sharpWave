## sharpWave
### A _pragmatic_ port of [JWave](https://github.com/graetz23/JWave) to C#

### Introduction
[JWave](https://github.com/graetz23/JWave) was ported to [sharpWave](https://github.com/graetz23/sharpWave) using Microsoft's C# programming language.

### HowTo
For a good how to use it; [JWave's github.io](http://graetz23.github.io/JWave/)

### building
For having a quick example, use _GNU/Linux_ having the _mono compiler_
available. Then try:

*git clone https://github.com/graetz23/sharpWave.git && cd sharpWave && make*

### remarks
Currently only a minimal function test is available:
- only 1-D orthogonal transform functions,
- only the Fast Wavelet Transform algorithms,
- only the orthonormal Haar Wavelet.

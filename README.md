### A _pragmatic_ port of [JWave](https://github.com/graetz23/JWave) to C#

### Introduction
[JWave](https://github.com/graetz23/JWave) was ported to [sharpWave](https://github.com/graetz23/sharpWave) as one of the first wavelet
libraries available in Microsoft's C# programming language.

### remarks
Currently only a minimal function test is available:
- only 1-D orthogonal transform functions,
- only the Fast Wavelet Transform algorithms,
- only the orthonormal Haar Wavelet.
